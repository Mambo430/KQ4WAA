Below you will find public Meshtastic Channels to use in conjunction with MQTT. 
If setup properly, this should act as a backbone to the decentralized mesh network while the Internet is still up. 
Additionally, it should not flood your your node db with the immense amount of nodes on the LongFast Channel. 

These are the standard configuration settings that I suggest.

Settings > LoRa
  Modem preset: LONG_FAST
  Hop limit: 3
  Override frequency (MHz): 906.875
  Ignore MQTT: unchecked
  OK to MQTT: checked
Settings > MQTT
  MQTT enabled: checked
  Address: mqtt.meshtastic.org
  Username: meshdev
  Password: large4cats
  Encryption enabled: checked
  JSON output enabled: unchecked
  TLS enabled: unchecked
  Root topic: msh/US   ##this allows the ablity to add other channels from other states if available and interested
  Proxy to client enabled: checked
  (optional) Map reporting: checked
  Precise location: unchecked
  (distance) 1194 ft ##this can be anything you feel comfortable with
